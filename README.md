# Bookstr app is my Final year university project.

Bookstr App is a handy, user friendly iOS book app.

The Bookstr app provides the user a great opportunity to search through a huge range of books provided by free Google API. 
When user types a book title into the search bar a list of books is listed under the search field.
User can scroll up and down through the displayed books, read the small description for each book and click on any of the displayed book cards.
When the new book detailed screen is loaded the desired book could be saved by taping on the “+” button in the right top corner, on this screen.
User could also tap on “Book Details Link” to view more information about this book, this view is external provided by Google API.
The user is also able to tap on the back button to dismiss this view and get back to the search screen.

Saved book is displayed on the main “My Reading List” screen, user could tap on the saved book title to open the books detail’s view.
User can delete any unwanted book from the saved book list when on the book details screen and when tap on the” Delete” button.

The Bookstr app provides a great readability experience to the user by switching the blurry mode background of the main screen, after the list of book grows greater than five.
